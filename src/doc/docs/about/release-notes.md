# 5.1.0 Release Notes

The main release feature is Junit 5 support.

* [General](#general)
* [Junit5](#junit5)
* [Spock updates](#spock-updates)
* [Junit4 extensions deprecated](#junit4-extensions-deprecated)

## General

* Guice updated to 4.2.3 ([java 14 support](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Guice423#changes-since-guice-422))
* Dropwizard updated to 2.0.10
* Changed `Automatic-Module-Name` to `ru.vyarus.dropwizard.guicey` because previous name was invalid
(ext modules names also changed)
 
## Junit 5

2 junit 5 extensions added:

* @TestDropwizardRule - full application start
* @TestGuiceyRule - guice-only tests (like old GuiceyAppRule)

Features:

* Guice beans could be injected into test fileds
* Guice beans could be injected as test (or lifecycle) method parameter
* 2 declaration types supported: as annotations on test class and field builer (vith `@RegisterExtension`)
* Hooks may be declared directly as test fields with lambdas
* Special `ClientSupport` object added to simplify web-related testing
* Support junit nested classes
* Support parallel tests

Example usage:

```java
@TestDropwizardApp(MyApp.class)
public class MyTest {
    
    @EnableHook
    static GuiceyConfigurationHook HOOK = builder -> builder.modules(new DebugModule());

    @Inject
    SomeBean bean;
    
    void testWebUrls(ClientSupport client) {
        Assertions.assertEquals("response string", 
                client.targetMain("servlet").request()
                        .buildGet()
                        .invoke()
                        .readEntity(String.class));
    }   
}
```

!!! note
    Thanks to vintage engine junit 5 may be used together with existing junit4 or spock tests.

Also, new junit extensions should be friendly to other extensions. Special static methods 
could be used to access DropwizardTestSupport, Injector and ClientSupport objects,
created by guicey extensions:

```java
public class MyExtension implements BeforeEachCallback {
    
    @Override
    public void beforeEach(ExtensionContext context) throws Exception {
        Injector injector = GuiceyExtensionsSupport.lookupInjector(context).get();
        ...
    }
}
```

## Spock updates

New junit 5 extensions was en evolution of existing spock extensions (junit 5 extension modle allow 
implementing thm the same way). Still, during development extensinos were improved and these improvements
were ported to spock.

Changes:

* New options in @UseDropwizardApp: randomPorts and restMapping
* Add support for hook declaration with test field:
    `@EnableHook static GuiceyConfigurationHook HOOK = { it.modules(new DebugModule()) }`
* @UseGuiceyHooks extension *deprecated* in favor of hooks declaration in fields
* Add `ClientSupport` object to simplify web tests:
    `@InjectClient ClientSupport client`
* Extensions no more rely on depcrecated juni4 rules, but use DropwizardTestSupport instead         

Old syntax remain for configOverride declaration (to preserve compatibility):

```groovy
@UseGuiceyApp(value = AutoScanApplication,
        configOverride = [
                @ConfigOverride(key = "foo", value = "2"),
                @ConfigOverride(key = "bar", value = "12")
        ])
```

It will be replaced with the new simplified junit5 syntax in the next breaking release.

Overall, juni5 and spock extensions are almost equivalent.

## Junit4 extensions deprecated

Existing junit4 rules were deprecated: GuiceyAppRule, StartupErrorRules   

Migration from junit 4 to junit 5:

* Instead of GuiceyAppRule use @TestGuiceyApp extension.
* Instead of DropwizardAppRule use @TestDropwizardApp extension.
* GuiceyHooksRule can be substituted with hooks declaration in extensions or as test fields
* There is no direct substitution for StartupErrorRule, but something similar could be achieved 
with 3rd party extensions

Also, with junit 5 vintage engine enabled, existing juni4 tests may be used together with 
new junit 5 rules.
